#Color Mixer!#

###Set Up###

1. `npm i`

2.  `gulp`

*note that css minify and course maps are commented out as they add a lot of time to the gulp task*

###Using the App###

3. `node server`

4. Browse to `localhost:3000`

5. Hover over a color to see its hex value.  Click it to add it to the "mixed colors" container.

6.  As more and more colors are clicked, the "mixed colors" container will become closer and closer to white  (adding hex values up to FF for RGB).
